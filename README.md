# Raycasting tests V2, I want to try out a more efficient way of raycasting .


This is part of my High school graduation project. I want to create a 3D engine using raycasting in Javascript.
With it, one would be able to create simple games without going through the raycasting implementation. It's like creating a 2D game where you can just pop inside it in first person.
A whole lot of ways already exist on the internet on how to implement this.
V1 and V2 of the project were implementations of The Coding Train's Coding challenge on raycasting with my own modifications.
I am currently working on a new version which uses vector math to determine the position of the walls without using so many rays. With that I can represent the walls with polygons instead of strips of rectangles on the screen.

The deadline is October 2021 and I have a lot to work on still but I am very passionate about finding new ways to think about the different problems I encounter.
